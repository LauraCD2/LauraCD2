# Hi there! 👋 

👩🏻‍💻 **I'm Laura Camila Diaz Delgado** (or just Mila!) – a B.Sc. Student in Computer Science at [UIS](https://www.uis.edu.co), passionate about coding, creativity, and collaboration. 🌟

🎨 **Coding is my art**, and I believe every project is an opportunity to bring imagination to life. 💡👩🏻‍💻

🎼 Outside of tech, I’m a **flutist, oboist**, and a proud **Soprano in [Coral Universitaria UIS](https://www.instagram.com/coraluniversitariauis.oficial/)** . 🎶 Music and coding are two ways I express myself and connect with the world. 🌍

✨ Let’s create something amazing together and bring a bit of joy and artistry to the world of tech. (I like emojis, not only GPT)
